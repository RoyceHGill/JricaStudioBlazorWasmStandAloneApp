            <br>
            <br>

            I understand that it is my responsibility to keep my eyes closed during the procedure and only open when advised by lash tech.
            <br>
            <br>

            I agree to disclose any allergies I may have.
            <br>
            <br>

            I understand that I need to listen to my lash technician’s instructions.
            <br>
            <br>

            I understand I need to follow the aftercare advise to maintain not only the eyelash extensions, but my own natural lashes.
            <br>
            <br>

            I understand all after care advice that my lash technician has given/ explained to me.
            <br>
            <br>

            I understand that due to the natural cycle, I will need to maintain my lashes and book touch up appointments recommended every 2-3 weeks.

            I understand that I have been advised I am not allowed to wear makeup around the eye area to my eyelash extension appointments and that in doing so I will be charge a removal fee and there is a chance th applied lashes may not hold due to left over residue.
            <br>

            I understand what a sample set is and agree I have been offered one.
            <br>
            <br>

            I understand that if I have chosen not to receive a sample set before going through with the procedure, that my lash technician is not liable in any way for any reactions or results from the procedure.
            <br>
            <br>

            I understand the infill on another lash techs work is not recommended and if completed my lashes may not last as long or look as good as a full set done by JRica.Studio service technician.
