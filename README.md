This application was built for my partner. She required a website for her business and I wanted to help. The main feature of the website was to give her clients the ability to browse here offerings and make appointments. but is also finds the next available appointment times based on business hours entered. The client facing side of the website is all about browsing and making appointments. The Administrator side of the website manages the appointments, allows here to cancel approve change details of appointments. She can add edit remove services, products and business details which are all taken into account when appointments are made by customers.
